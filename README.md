# Vila de Vie Hotel Website

This project focuses on the front-end of a hotel website. Our team wants to create a simple, easy-to-use booking website for people of all ages. This is the continued work for the [Vila de Via](https://github.com/nlmhanh110/Vila-de-Vie). In this project, we've applied NodeJS, Angular Framework, MongoDB and many related moduleds. There will be some things we need to fix and work on more. Hope you find this project worth it!

## Motivation
We have a chance to dive into the front-end development at our university. We want to use our knowledge in a practical project and gain more experience from it. Vila de Via, a hotel booking website, is the subject that our team's all interested in.
